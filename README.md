# Build A Formik Form
A simple form created using formik.  In this exercise we learned how to implement toolchains and how to work with React in new ways.

# Useage
Cloning the repo and opening the index.html file in a live server will run the program.

# Roadmap
I'd like to continue working with this form to maybe implent more entry fields, and perhaps more styling to the overall body of the page.
